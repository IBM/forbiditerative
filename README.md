# Forbid-Iterative (FI) Planner is an Automated PDDL based planner that includes planners for top-k, top-quality, and diverse computational tasks.

## The codebase consists of multiple planners, for multiple computational problems, roughly divided into three categories:

1. Top-k planning
2. Top-quality planning  
    2.1. Top-quality planning  
    2.2. Unordered top-quality planning  
    2.3. Sub(multi)set top-quality planning  
3. Diverse planning  
    3.1. Satisficing/Agile diverse planning  
    3.2. Bounded diversity diverse planning  
    3.3. Bounded quality diverse planning  
    3.4. Bounded quality and diversity diverse planning  
    3.5. Bounded quality optimal diversity diverse planning  

## The planners are based on the idea of obtaining multiple solutions by iteratively reformulating planning tasks to restrict the set of valid plans, forbidding previously found ones. Thus, the planners can be referred to as FI-top-k, FI-top-quality, FI-unordered-top-quality, FI-diverse-{agl,sat,bD,bQ,bQbD, bQoptD}.

The example invocation code can be found (for the corresponding computational problem) in  
1. plan_topk.sh or plan_topk_via_unordered_topq.sh  
2.   
    2.1. plan_topq_via_topk.sh or plan_topq_via_unordered_topq.sh  
    2.2. plan_unordered_topq.sh  
    2.3. plan_{subset,submultiset}_topq.sh  
3.   
    3.1. plan_diverse_{agl,sat}.sh  
3.2. plan_diverse_bounded.sh  
3.3. plan_quality_bounded_diverse_sat.sh  
3.4. plan_quality_bounded_diversity_bounded_diverse.sh  
3.5. plan_quality_bounded_diversity_optimal_diverse.sh

# Dependencies
For some of the diverse planners, the dependencies are as follows:
1. Computation of a subset of plans is performed in a post-processing, path to the code should be specified in an environment variable **DIVERSE_SCORE_COMPUTATION_PATH**. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/IBM/diversescore).
2. Note that for the diversity-bounded diverse planning and for diversity-optimal one the computation in a post-processing requires enabling CPLEX support in Fast Downward (see https://www.fast-downward.org/) and building the post-processing code with LP support.

# Using as a package:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/IBM/forbiditerative.git
```
Due to the CLI-oriented design, the code must be run using subprocess.
```python
import sys
import subprocess
import logging
from pathlib import Path
from subprocess import SubprocessError
from forbiditerative import plan

planner_bin = Path(plan.__file__).parent / 'builds' / 'bin'
try:
    sys.dont_write_bytecode = True  # abseil's driver attempts to dynamically load .py files and fails if __pycache__ is generated
    output = subprocess.check_output([sys.executable, plan.__file__, "..your args"])
except SubprocessError as err:
    logging.error(err.output.decode())
```

## History

The current version of Fast Downward is the merger of three different
projects:

- the original version of Fast Downward developed by Malte Helmert
  and Silvia Richter
- LAMA, developed by Silvia Richter and Matthias Westphal based on
  the original Fast Downward
- FD-Tech, a modified version of Fast Downward developed by Erez
  Karpas and Michael Katz based on the original code

In addition to these three main sources, the codebase incorporates
code and features from numerous branches of the Fast Downward codebase
developed for various research papers. The main contributors to these
branches are Malte Helmert, Gabi Röger and Silvia Richter.
